Galaxy has a tool to merge STDF files but it has drawbacks:
	-Need to upload both files to Galaxy server and download merged file
	-No audit trail record to mark the file as a merged file
	-PRR PID field not updated to be consistent between files. i.e. PRR for given (X,Y) can have different PID in different files.
	-Retest count is set to zero
	-discrepency between part count in WRR and PCR
	-discards many TSR fields including TEST_MIN, TEST_MAX, TST_SUMS, TST_SQRS, TEST_TIME and more 

merge_stdf_v2 should not be used, has bug where it discards limits/units information for some tests
merge_stdf_v4 is working without known issues

Steps to merge stdf file:
1) Add audit trail record to mark the file as a merged file
2) update part count, good count, retest count in WRR, PCR
3) update PID and part flag supercede bit in PRR
4) update HBR and SBR bin counts, merged file must include HBR/SBR from both source files
5) update TSR - EXEC_CNT, FAIL_CNT, ALRM_CNT, TEST_MIN, TEST_MAX, TST_SUMS, TST_SQRS, TEST_TIME
